2 + 1 = 3

"Two plus one equals three"

## Using Your Fingers
To add 3 + 2:
1. Hold up 3 fingers
2. Hold up 2 more fingers
3. Count all fingers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5!

## What is Subtraction?
Subtraction means TAKING AWAY to find what's LEFT.

We use the MINUS sign: -
We use the EQUALS sign: =

## Let's Subtract!

## Using Your Fingers
To subtract 7 - 3:
1. Hold up 7 fingers
2. Put down 3 fingers
3. Count what's left: 4!
7 - 3 = 4

## Key Subtraction Words
- Take away
- Minus
- Left
- Fewer
- Difference

## Building on What We Know
We know how to add to 10. Now let's go to 20!

## Making 10 First
A great strategy is to "Make 10":

8 + 5 = ?
Think: 8 + 2 = 10, and 3 more = 13
So 8 + 5 = 13

## Doubles
Doubles are easy to remember!
6 + 6 = 12
7 + 7 = 14
8 + 8 = 16
9 + 9 = 18
10 + 10 = 20

## Doubles Plus One
If you know doubles, this is easy!
6 + 7 = 6 + 6 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13
8 + 9 = 8 + 8 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17

## Adding Tens
10 + 5 = 15
10 + 8 = 18
When we add to 10, we just put the number after the 1!

A clock has:
- **12 numbers** (1-12)
- **Short hand** = HOUR hand (tells the hour)
- **Long hand** = MINUTE hand (tells the minutes)

## O'Clock Times
When the long hand points to 12, it's "o'clock"!

🕐 1:00 = one o'clock
🕑 2:00 = two o'clock
🕒 3:00 = three o'clock
🕓 4:00 = four o'clock

🕙 10:00 = ten o'clock
🕚 11:00 = eleven o'clock
