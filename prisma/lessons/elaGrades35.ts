    intro: {
      title: 'Main Idea and Supporting Details',
      description: 'Learn to identify main ideas and details in texts',
      content: `# Main Idea and Supporting Details

## What is the Main Idea?
The **main idea** is the most important point of a passage. It's what the text is mostly about.

## What are Supporting Details?
**Supporting details** are facts, examples, or descriptions that tell more about the main idea.

## Finding the Main Idea

### Strategy 1: Ask "What is this mostly about?"
After reading, ask yourself: If I could only say ONE thing about this passage, what would it be?

### Strategy 2: Look at the First and Last Sentences
Authors often state the main idea at the beginning or end of a paragraph.

### Strategy 3: Find the Common Thread
What do all the details have in common? That's likely the main idea!

## The Table Analogy
Think of a paragraph like a table:
- **Main Idea** = Table top (holds everything together)
- **Supporting Details** = Table legs (hold up the main idea)

\`\`\`
     [MAIN IDEA]
    /    |    \\

## Example
**Passage:** Recycling helps our planet in many ways. It reduces the amount of garbage in landfills. Recycling also saves natural resources like trees and water. In addition, it uses less energy than making new products. Everyone should recycle to help the Earth.

*The alarm didn't go off. The car wouldn't start. The bus had already left. When I finally arrived, everyone was already seated.*

**Implied main idea:** Everything went wrong, causing me to be late.

## What are Context Clues?
**Context clues** are hints in the text that help you figure out the meaning of unfamiliar words.

## Types of Context Clues

### 1. Definition Clues
The author directly tells you what the word means.

**Signal words:** is, means, refers to, is called

*An **arachnid** is a spider-like creature with eight legs.*

### 2. Synonym Clues
A word with similar meaning is nearby.

**Signal words:** or, like, also known as

*The dog was **famished**, or extremely hungry.*

### 3. Antonym Clues
A word with opposite meaning helps you understand.

**Signal words:** but, however, unlike, instead

*Unlike her timid sister, Maria was **bold** and outspoken.*

### 4. Example Clues
Examples help explain the word.

**Signal words:** such as, for example, like, including

*The store sold **produce** such as apples, carrots, and lettuce.*

### 5. Inference Clues
You use logic and what you already know.

*The **scorching** sun made everyone seek shade.*
(Logic: If people need shade, it must be very hot.)

## Strategy: CLUES
