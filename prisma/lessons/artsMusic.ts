## What are the Elements of Art?
The elements of art are the basic visual components artists use to create artwork. Think of them as the vocabulary of art.

## The Seven Elements

### 1. Line
Lines are marks that move through space.
- **Types:** Straight, curved, zigzag, wavy
- **Qualities:** Thick, thin, rough, smooth
- **Functions:** Outline, show movement, create texture

### 2. Shape
Shapes are enclosed areas defined by lines.
- **Geometric:** Circles, squares, triangles
- **Organic:** Free-form, irregular, natural shapes
- **2D:** Have height and width only

### 3. Form
Forms are 3-dimensional shapes.
- **Geometric forms:** Sphere, cube, cylinder, cone
- **Organic forms:** Natural, irregular 3D shapes
- **Have depth:** Height, width, and depth

### 4. Color
Color is light reflected off surfaces.
- **Primary colors:** Red, yellow, blue
- **Secondary colors:** Orange, green, violet
- **Properties:** Hue, value, intensity

### 5. Value
Value is the lightness or darkness of a color.
- **Tint:** Add white (lighter)
- **Shade:** Add black (darker)
- **Creates:** Depth and dimension

### 6. Texture
Texture is how a surface feels or looks like it feels.
- **Actual texture:** Real, touchable
- **Implied texture:** Visual, looks like texture
- **Examples:** Smooth, rough, soft, hard

### 7. Space
Space is the area around and within objects.
- **Positive space:** The subject
- **Negative space:** Background/empty areas
- **Depth:** Illusion of 3D on 2D surface`,

    intro: {
      title: 'Shading Techniques',
      description: 'Creating form through value',
      content: `# Shading Techniques

## Why Shading Matters
Shading transforms flat shapes into 3D forms. It creates depth, volume, and realism.

## Understanding Light

### Light Source
- Direction light comes from
- Determines where shadows fall
- Consistency is crucial

### Elements of Shading
1. **Highlight:** Brightest area, directly facing light
2. **Mid-tone:** Average value between light and dark
3. **Core shadow:** Darkest part on object
4. **Reflected light:** Light bouncing from surface
5. **Cast shadow:** Shadow on ground/surface

## Shading Techniques

### Hatching
- Parallel lines
- Direction follows form
- Closer lines = darker

### Cross-Hatching
- Overlapping line sets
- Different angles
- Creates darker values

### Stippling
- Dots
- More dots = darker
- Time-consuming but smooth

### Blending
- Smooth transitions
- Use blending stump or finger
- Good for soft edges

### Scribbling
- Random circular motions
- Creates texture
- Quick and expressive

## Value Scale
Create a range from light to dark:
1. White
2. Light gray
3. Medium gray
4. Dark gray
5. Black

Practice gradual transitions between values.`,

  'art-composition': {
    intro: {
      title: 'Composition',
      description: 'Arranging elements effectively in artwork',
      content: `# Composition

## What is Composition?
Composition is the arrangement of visual elements in artwork. Good composition guides the viewer's eye and creates visual interest.

## Basic Composition Guidelines

### Rule of Thirds
- Divide image into 9 equal parts
- Place subjects at intersections
- Creates dynamic balance
- Avoids centering everything

### Golden Ratio
- Mathematical proportion (1:1.618)
- Found in nature
- Pleasing to the eye
- Spiral guides placement

### Focal Point
- Main area of interest
- Where eye goes first
- Created through contrast, placement, detail

## Composition Techniques

### Leading Lines
- Guide viewer's eye
- Can be literal or implied
- Point toward focal point

### Framing
- Use elements to frame subject
- Trees, doorways, windows
- Adds depth

### Balance
- Symmetrical: Formal, stable
- Asymmetrical: Dynamic, interesting

### Negative Space
- Empty areas around subject
- Gives subject "room to breathe"
- Creates sophisticated look

## Common Mistakes
- Centering everything
- Cutting off important parts
- Cluttered backgrounds
- Competing focal points
- Tangents (edges touching awkwardly)`,
      objectives: ['Understand composition principles', 'Apply rule of thirds', 'Create effective focal points']
    },
    practice: {
      title: 'Composition Practice',
      description: 'Develop composition skills',
      content: `# Composition Practice

## Rule of Thirds Exercise
1. Draw a rectangle
2. Divide into thirds (vertical and horizontal)
3. Place a subject at one intersection
4. Note how it feels different from center

## Thumbnail Sketches
Create 9 small compositions (2" x 3"):
- Same subject, different arrangements
- Quick, exploratory
- Focus on placement, not detail

## Focal Point Study
For each composition, create emphasis through:
1. Contrast (light/dark)
2. Size (large subject)
3. Isolation (alone in space)
4. Detail (more refined than surroundings)

## Leading Lines
Find or create compositions using:
- Roads or paths
- Fences or rails
- Natural lines (rivers, branches)
- Architectural lines

## Cropping Exercise
Take a rectangular piece of paper:
- Use it as a viewfinder
- Find interesting compositions in room
- Sketch what you see

## Analysis
Look at 5 artworks/photos and identify:
- Where is the focal point?
- What technique creates it?
- How is balance achieved?
- What rules are followed/broken?

## Quick Compositions
Create 3 compositions:
1. Horizontal format
2. Vertical format
3. Square format
Same subject, adapted to each format`,

## Advanced Techniques

### Visual Weight
Factors that add weight:
- Size
- Color intensity
- Contrast
- Detail
- Position (lower = heavier)

### Movement and Flow
Create visual paths:
- Repeated shapes
- Color connections
- Implied lines
- Gestural flow

### Breaking Rules Intentionally
- Center for formal effect
- Imbalance for tension
- Know rules to break them effectively

## Composition Types

### Open Composition
- Elements extend beyond frame
- Suggests larger scene
- Dynamic feeling

### Closed Composition
- Everything contained within frame
- Complete, self-contained
- Traditional approach

### Dynamic vs. Static
- Diagonals = dynamic
- Horizontals/verticals = stable
- Choose based on mood

## Multiple Subjects
- Odd numbers often work better
- Create relationships between subjects
- Overlapping adds depth
- Vary sizes for interest

## Portfolio Project

### Series of 5 Compositions
Create artworks demonstrating:
1. Rule of thirds
2. Leading lines
3. Framing
4. Dynamic balance
5. Intentional rule-breaking

### Requirements
- Same medium throughout
- Consistent size
- Artist statement explaining choices
- Critique-ready presentation

## Self-Evaluation Questions
- Does the eye know where to go?
- Is there interesting balance?
- Does composition support the subject?
- Would cropping improve it?`,
